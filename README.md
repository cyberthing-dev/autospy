# autospy

Cyberthing product. In-house social media monitoring solution developed for NTFC (North Texas Fusion Center). For ethical use only.

## How it works

AutoSpy (a play on autopsy) is designed for left-of-boom (preemptive) monitoring for disaster prevention. Agents can link subject's name, social media account(s), etc. and AutoSpy will perform OSINT, aggregate data, and generate a report using `GPT-4`. AutoSpy can additionally use `yt-dl` to analyze a copy of media content and transcribe audio via `Whisper` and view frames from video via `GPT-4-vision`.

Agents can additionally use AutoSpy to monitor headlines and specify key terms in social media to listen for.
